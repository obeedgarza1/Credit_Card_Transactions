# Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection and Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activities using machine learning and data visualization. The dataset includes various features such as transaction amount, time of day, location, and customer demographics, providing deep insights into spending patterns and fraud trends.

## Key Findings
🕒 Fraudulent transactions tend to occur more frequently at night and involve higher amounts.

🌳 Trained a Random Forest classifier to predict fraudulent transactions with notable accuracy.

📊 The transaction size by age analysis shows that while younger customers have higher transaction volumes, older customers are more likely to make larger purchases.

🌍 Geographic analysis reveals higher instances of fraud in certain regions, visualized through a choropleth map.

👥 Gender-based spending analysis highlights distinct differences in spending categories between males and females.

## Project Highlights
### Machine Learning:
Implemented a Random Forest model to classify fraudulent transactions.
Key features include transaction amount, time of day, geographic data, and customer information.

### Data Visualization:
Built interactive dashboards using Tableau to display transaction patterns, fraud trends, and demographic insights.
Visuals include:
Transaction size by age with categories like small, medium, large, etc.
Time of day heatmap showing fraud activity peaking during evening and night hours.
Choropleth map depicting transaction counts and fraud hotspots by state.
